            Drawing is a medicine to me. It is as for it calms me down and it's very peaceful. I use drawings to express my feelings, especially with colors. It cleary puts out the mood and expresses emotions in a beautiful way. I like it because it increases my creativity and ideas and it is relaxing. This is why I believe drawing is peaceful. It is a desire most people need. It actually inspires me and encourages me to join its world of sketches.

            My inspiration to start drawing as a hobby was my mum. She draws and paints wonderous things that you would be impressed with. She is very artistic and loves to paint. I have learned many things about sketching and have used it to improve. Drawing can change me and even you!
